                Best gangster movie, the cast is great, lots of action and a good story line. One of my favorite movies of all time.

            <p>
                ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />
                The two sides of the story being Robert De Niro and Al Pacino is a very good pairing. This movie has lots of depth to it I like it a lot.

            <h2>Cape Fear</h2>
            <p>
                ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />
                I like this movie a lot, I like the chase aspect to it. Some parts are a bit creepy and feel a bit wrong but the action near the end makes up for it really rattles your bones.

            <h2>Taxi Driver</h2>
            <p>
                ⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />
                The music in this movie is just great, the storyline is a bit confusing and twisted. Its interesting because in some parts you cant tell what is real and what isnt.
