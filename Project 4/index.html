     <h2><b>A Review of HTML</b></h2>
     <p>HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements
        that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters. <br> The best part of HTML is that once we know
        how to effectively use basic elements, we can now look up how to use all of the others!
